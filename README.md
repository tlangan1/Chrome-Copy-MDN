# Description of the copy options in the elements tab of Chrome version 102.0.5005.63

## To get to the copy options go to the elements tab and right-mouse click a node in the DOM. This opens a context menu where they can be found. I used the navigation portion of the MDN url "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu" to obtain the examples in this project. The node I used is identified in the copy-selector.html file. It is basically the navigation header at the top of the web page and is referred to below as "the node". Each "html" file contains the result of the copy option associated with its name.

### Options:

1. Copy element: I believe this option and the "Copy outerHTML" option are the same. They each return the HTML associated with "the node".
1. Copy outerHTML: I believe this option and the "Copy element" option are the same.
1. Copy selector: This results in a "CSS" description of "the node".
1. Copy JS path: This results in a JavaScript expression to return a handle to "the node".
1. Copy styles: This results in the CSS being applied to "the node".
1. Copy XPath: An XML Path Language description of "the node". I am not sure what the difference between this and the "full XPath" is.

### Notes:

1. The test-mdn-features.html is what it appears. It is just a container to experiment with the different features MDN uses in its website.
